/*
 * SHORT DESCRIPTION
 */

Here is structure, description and materials for all topics I am currently thoroughly interested in.
ALERT: this file is different from TODO, which stored short-term actual information.

/*
 * STRATEGY
 */

// additional information:
// + represents full accomplishing;
// ~ represents learning in parallel

* repeating of the school program in following subjects:
	~ mathematics:
		~ algebra;
		~ geometry;
	~ physics;
	~ chemistry;
	~ biology (mostly genetics);
	~ history;
	~ english language;
	~ additional;
* accomplishing Scanavi tasks;
* learning & repeating of the discrete mathematics;
* Tanenbaum materials:
	* structured computer organization;
	* modern operating systems;
	* computer networking;
	* parallel and distributed systems;
* K&R C language;
* x86 assembly language;
* operating systems:
	* xv6, UNIX v6, System V, BSD;
	* writing my own one.
In parallel with:
~ chess;
~ my project:
	* the concept;
	* map-writing software;
	* fabula etc.;
~ English language:
	~ grammar;
	~ lexicon;
	~ verbal interpretation;
~ GRE;
~ UNIX environment:
	~ Gentoo Linux;
	~ shell script;
	~ BSD;
	~ Vim/Emacs;
~ TeX typesetting system.

/*
 * RESEARCH PROJECTS IN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
 */

Passing all courses requires creating all of the projects listed below:
* monolithic UNIX-like kernel (see ygg);
* microkernel;
* exokernel;
* TCP/IP stack;
* CPU (digital design, microarchitecture, ISA);
* C compiler for x86;
* new language for system programming;
* programming editor (C + Lisp);
* mathematical solver in x86 asm;
* emulator for x86;
* map-generating software;
* generic data structures & algorithms library.

Also an article must be written for each of them.

/*
 * UNIVERSITY COURSES
 */

I also must finish some courses from top universities:
* MIT: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/;
* Berkeley: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/classes-eecs.html?_ga=1.189091115.1408716772.1476205445;
* Stanford: http://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofengineering/computerscience/#courseinventory;
* CMU: http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schoolofcomputerscience/courses/.

Additional materials from the web:
* Saylor Academy online courses: https://learn.saylor.org/course/index.php?categoryid=9.

/*
 * TERMS
