/*
 * SHORT DESCRIPTION
 */

It's my own CS curriculum, focused mainly on system programming and related fields (but it includes some other topics as well).
It consists of 14 main & 4 additional courses, with reading some books for each of them & doing a set of projects (not for each course (projects are more integral), however, most of books include their own exercises).
Also, I am going to pass sets of courses from 4 top CS programs: MIT, Berkeley, Stanford & CMU & some additional materials.

/*
 * STRUCTURE
 */

Main courses:
* mathematics:
	- discrete mathematics;
	- linear algebra & analytic geometry;
* algorithms & data structures;
* electronics;
* computer architecture:
	- digital design;
	- microarchitecture;
	- instruction set architecture;
	- x86 (16-, 32-, 64-bit) architecture & assembly language;
* operating systems:
	- os theory;
	- kernel programming;
* networks;
* parallel & distributed systems;
* translators & linkers;
* C programming.

Additional courses:
* mathematics:
	- calculus;
	- mathematical optimizations;
* Lisp programming;
* UNIX environment.

Book directory tree is organized mostly according to the same logic.

/*
 * RESEARCH
 */

Passing all courses requires creating all of the projects listed below:
* monolithic UNIX-like kernel (see ygg);
* microkernel;
* exokernel;
* TCP/IP stack;
* CPU (digital design, microarchitecture, ISA);
* C compiler for x86;
* new language for system programming;
* programming editor (C + Lisp).

Also an article must be written for each of them.

/*
 * UNIVERSITY COURSES
 */

I also must finish some interesting courses from top universities:
* MIT: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/;
* Berkeley: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/classes-eecs.html?_ga=1.189091115.1408716772.1476205445;
* Stanford: http://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofengineering/computerscience/#courseinventory;
* CMU: http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schoolofcomputerscience/courses/.

Here is additional materials from the web:
* Saylor Academy online courses: https://learn.saylor.org/course/index.php?categoryid=9.

/*
 * TERMS
 */

Approximate period of passing all courses is 2017-2018.
